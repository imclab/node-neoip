- make a casti_ctrl_t
- write a test tool which controls the number of stream and number of clients per stream.
  - such a tool will give working test + stress test
  - how to check casto client is receiving the proper data
- node-chargen provides the source of the stream
**********************************************************************
casti_ctrl_t:
- look in book how to write such object
- ctor(opts, callback)
  - opts contains all url options
  - what about the refresh period ? in the same or in another ?
  - callback(error, cast_privhash)
- is_started()
- start()
- stop()
- dtor() = if is_started() then stop()
*************************************************************************
casto_testclient_t:
- used for test and to hold knowledge on how to code a client, so all options
  must be available
- ctor(opts, callback)
  - callback(error)
  - opts = {
	cast_privhash
	cast_name
    }
- how to test proper data are received and received in time
  - meanwhile just print it
*************************************************************************
how to write the test:
- start a node-chargen in 127.0.0.1 8124
- create N casti_ctrl pointing on this node-chargen
- create M http client to casto reading those stream
