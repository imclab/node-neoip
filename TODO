Make a website

***********************************************************
TODO
- contrib/
  - casti test/oload test
- make it installable
- how to handle test and docs
  - for exes, docs == man
  - for class, docs == jsdoc
- what about a class == exe, contain manpage in pod + test + cmdline
  - this fit well the unicity issue
  - make a source rather dirty tho
***********************************************************
NAMING:
- big issue in naming
- how to name executable
  - neoip-detect to detect applications
  - neoip-url to build url... how to distinguish from oload and casto ?
    - if --stream is contained process.argv[] remove it and launch casto
    - if --static, launch oload
    - if none, launch oload
- how to name files and class
  - usually i use _t at the end of class. This make a clear diff between the naming
    of the object and the naming of the class
  - some use upper/lower char instead
***********************************************************
Web compatibility:
- how to be compatible with web
  - what need to be compatible ?
  - oload_url_builder/casto_url_builder
  - app detect
